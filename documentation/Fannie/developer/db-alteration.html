Occasionally a developer may wish to change an existing table
or view. This has the potential to be more disruptive to other
users, so the process is a bit different and requires confirmation
rather than being automated.
<p />
Updates must be placed in the install/updates directory.
Update files should be named with a date and time stamp -
i.e., YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.php. This means they sort sensibly into
chronological order.
<p />
The update file should contain a class named
<b>update_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</b> the extends the provided base
class <b>UpdateObj</b> (class names can't start with a number).
In most cases an update class will just define a few properties:
<ul>
<li> <i>$timestamp</i> should be the same YYYYMMDDHHMMSS date and time.
<li> <i>$author</i> should say who you are
<li> <i>$description</i> should explain what the update does.
<li> <i>$queries</i> is the the actual update. It should contain 
three entries with keys: <i>op</i>, <i>trans</i>, and <i>archive</i>.
Each entry is an array of queries to perform on the respective
databases.
</ul>
Look at existing updates for examples. It's very light coding; you're 
really just defining variables.
