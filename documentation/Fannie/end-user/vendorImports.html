<p> This document discusses how to import spreadsheets of
vendor pricing info. This information is used to
calculate pricing based on desired margins.
</p>

<h2>Step 1: Create Vendor(s)</h2>
To import vendor information, you need vendors.
Select Item Maintenance =&gt; <i>Manage Vendors</i>
from Fannie's left hand menu. In the drop down, choose <i>New vendor...</i>
and give the vendor a name.
<p />
You can optionally enter a vendor's department scheme
(e.g., UNFI's categories). This is to support vendor-specific
margins. See <b>Calculating SRPs</b> below.
<p />
You can upload vendor CSVs here using the <i>Update catalog</i>
link. This works OK for small vendors, but not so well for
really large catalogs. Dedicated loading scripts work better
in these cases. Fannie
currently includes scripts for the following vendors:
<ul>
	<li>Eclectic Institute - <i>loadECLECTICprices.php</i></li>
	<li>Herb Pharm - <i>loadHPprices.php</i></li>
	<li>Natural Factors - <i>loadNFACTORprices.php</i></li>
	<li>Nature's Plus - <i>loadNPATHprices.php</i></li>
	<li>Oregon's Wild Harvest - <i>loadOWHprices.php</i></li>
	<li>Select - <i>loadSELECTprices.php</i></li>
	<li>Simpler's - <i>loadSIMPprices.php</i></li>
	<li>Suki - <i>loadSUKIprices.php</i></li>
	<li>UNFI - <i>loadUNFIprices.php</i></li>
	<li>Vitamer - <i>loadVITAMERprices.php</i></li>
</ul>
You do have to type or copy/paste the name of the appropriate
script manually. Sorry.
These scripts are all designed around the spreadsheets WFC
has received. I don't know if all these vendors use a consistent
format. The bigger ones like UNFI probably do, but that's not a 
guarantee.

<h2>Step 2: Change the spreadsheet to a CSV</h2>
Fannie doesn't speak Excel, at least in this case. Open the file,
and use Save As to change the format to CSV (if you get more than
one CSV option, look for one mentioning Windows to get correct
line-endings). If the file is larger than a couple MBs, you may
need to compress it to avoid upload limits. Use the utility of your
choose to zip it.

<h2>Step 3: Upload the file</h2>
Select Sales Batches =&gt; <i>Vendor Pricing</i> from Fannie's left
hand menu. On the next page choose <i>Upload Price Sheet</i>. Choose
the correct vendor from the drop down menu, then upload your CSV
(or zipped CSV).
<p />
<i>This upload can take a long time. Like 10-15 minutes. Part of this
is weird voodoo to avoid memory/CPU limits on old hardware, and part of
it is dealing with partial pricing files. Many vendors only include
changed items in the file; updating items one at a time rather than
dumping all info and rebuilding essentially doubles execution time</i>.

<h2>Step 4: Calculate SRPs</h2>
Return to the Vendor Pricing menu via Fannie's menu (Sales Batches
=&gt; Vendor Pricing) and choose <i>Recalculate SRPs</i>. Select the
vendor, then click recalculate.
<p />
Fannie checks two places for desired margin. Top priority is vendor
department settings. You can load vendor's department numbering
scheme (e.g., UNFI's categories) and assign these margin percentages.
This is currently a manual process to nag your DBA about. If vendor
departments aren't used for this vendor, Fannie uses the POS department
margin setting. See <a href="departments.html">departments</a> for
instructions on defining department margins [2Sep2012 it does not in
fact have instructions about that].
<p />

<h2>Step 5: Create a Price Change Batch</h2>
Return to the Vendor Pricing menu via Fannie's menu (Sales Batches
=&gt; Vendor Pricing) and choose <i>Create Price Change Batch</i>. 
Select the vendor and optionally super department. <i>All</i> is fine
if you aren't using super departments. The default value, No, for
<i>Show All Items</i> excludes everything where the current POS price
matches the calculated SRP. Click <i>Continue</i>.
<p />
A price change batch is created immediately. Its name is listed at the
top of the page. If you return to this tool on the same day, it will
just resume editing that same batch.
<p />
Green rows show items where current margin exceeds desired margin.
Red rows show items where current margin is below desired margin.
White rows show items marked in the <i>Var</i> column. This is for
marking items that purposely ignore normal margin.
<p />
Clicking <i>Add</i> will put that item into the price change batch
with the listed SRP. You can also adjust the calculated SRPs by
click on them. Click <i>Del</i> to remove an item from the price
change batch if it was added by mistake.

<h2>Step 6: Apply new prices</h2>
Go to the batch tool (<i>Sales Batches</i> in Fannie's left hand menu)
and either manually force your price change batch or give it
a start date for a later, automated application.
