The installation script for IS4C also servers as a configuration
page. It's broken into three sections (links at the top):
<i>Necessities</i>, which is the bare minimum to get a lane up and running,
<i>Additional Configuration</i>, which deals with per-store
customizations and peripheral configuration, and <i>Sample Data</i>,
which populates part of the database for quick testing.
<h3>Necessities</h3>
<ul>
<li><i>ini.php</i> status. This file is IS4C's configuration. It must be writable
or you can't save changes. On Unix-style systems, the best option is
to change ownership of the file to whichever user is running apache (the install
script will try to determine who that is for you). On Windows, the whole file system
is probably writable.</li>
<li><i>OS</i> choices are Windows (for Windows) and *nix (for anything else). If this
isn't set correctly, database connections will likely fail.</li>
<li><i>Lane Number</i> transactions logs include a lane number. Having a unique number
for each production lane is probably a good idea.</li>
<li><i>Lane Databases</i> connection requires a host, DBMS type, username, and password.
The two lane database are traditionally called opdata and translog, but do not
have to be. Once the correct connection information is entered, the install script will
automatically create any missing databases, tables, and views.</li>
<li><i>Server Database</i> connection has similar requirements to the lane database
connection. Again the install script will create missing databases, tables, and views.
If you skip this configuration, the lane will operate in standalone mode. For testing
purposes, that's probably fine. Note: it is highly recommended that the server
<b>database name</b> differ from the lane database names. The default is is4c_op.</li>
<li><i>Taxes</i> is for sales tax rates. Bear in mind that a given item can only have
one tax rate. If, for example, you have a state sales tax of 5% and a city sales tax
of 3%, you may need to enter tax rates of 3%, 5%, <b>and</b> 8%, depending on how
the rates overlap.</li>
<h3>Additional Configuration</h3>
These options are all labeled pretty clearly on the install page.
<h3>Sample Data</h3>
This page lets you load employees, customers (custdata), products, and departments.
Customers and products are the only items strictly necessary to get going.
There is a training login number, 9999, built into IS4C. Departments don't actually
have to exist at the register unless you're doing open rings. 
</ul>
