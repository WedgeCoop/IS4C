COMPILATION

1. Windows
	Compilation on Windows requires
	* .NET 2.0 Runtime
	* .NET 2.0 SDK
	The latter provides a special command line
	with all the appropriate environment variables
	set. Use that (or set them yourself) then
	run make.bat
2. Non-windows
	Requires mono.
	Use the makefile.
