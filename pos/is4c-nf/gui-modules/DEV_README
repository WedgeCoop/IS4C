gui-modules
---------------------------------------------

These scripts are "top-level" display scripts.
They are contained directly in the main frame set,
gui-base.php. These are the pages that will actually
be "visisted" as IS4C runs.

All gui-modules are subclasses of a gui-class-lib class.
This gets rid of some redundant code sections and scripts.

In an ideal world, it also makes adding new gui-modules
easier.

pos2.php is the script for the "main" display. This is
the most complicated gui-module. It relies on the parser
classes in parser-class-lib.
