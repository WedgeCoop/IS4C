This branch of IS4C is a fairly large overhaul from
the original code base. These DEV_README files provide some
insight into why I made certain changes.

The directory structure has been added to provide a bit
more organization.

DIRECTORIES:
ajax-driver	a python wrapper for connecting serial
		port data to the web browser

graphics	image files used in IS4C

gui-class-lib	a set of classes for writing pages to the screen

gui-modules	all the php scripts that are "top level" pages
		that is pages that are loaded in the main frame set

lib		php scripts containing nothing but functions

Magellan	a VB wrapper for connecting serial port data
		to the web browser	

parser-class-lib	a set of classes for processing input

./		php files that have yet to be categorized :)

The graphics / display system has been altered a great deal
so that everything is displayed through a single top-level 
frameset script, ./gui-base.php. GUI changes are discussed
in greater depth in gui-class-lib and gui-modules.
