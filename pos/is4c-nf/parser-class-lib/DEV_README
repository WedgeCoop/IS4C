parser-class-lib
-------------------------------------

These classes are the driving force behind the
pos2 gui-module. They are all implementations
of the Parser class, which contains two methods:

check(string)
parse(string)

The check method takes a string and decides whether
it should be handled by this object. This method
should return True or False.

The parse method processes the string. The return
type of this function can be altered as needed.

In practice, the line between these two functions
blurs a bit. Sometimes part, or even all, of the processing
gets done in check(). This is fine, so long as the
interface behaves consistently for an external caller.

The goal of this redesign is to make input processing
more modular. Tracing through multiple files to debug the input
process is a bit more of a pain (or perhaps a push; the
if/else/switch mess that was in pos2.php was less than ideal),
but adding or removing location-specific input handling is
really simple. Just adust the array of parser objects in pos2.php.
