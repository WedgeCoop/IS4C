INSTALLATION

Stick the fannie files somewhere on an apache
web server that has PHP installed (tested mostly
with 5.x)

Have a MySQL server or MS SQL Server accessible
somewhere on the network

Navigate to fannie's install.php script. The only
real gotcha is fannie's config.php has to be
writeable by apache to save your set up.
