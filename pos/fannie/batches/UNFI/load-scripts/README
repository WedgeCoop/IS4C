The load* files exist to populate the vendorItems table.
Data files from vendors vary wildly in format, so each
has its own file.

The upload script (up a directoy) will place the loaded
file in ../tmp, unzip it if needed, and name it
"unfi.csv". Unzip behavior is probably *nix only.

Adding support for a new vendor:

The load files really just need to push data into
the vendorItems table. The provided ones do some weird
redirecting-to-themselves to avoid PHP memory / time
limits. Folks with newer servers can probably just up
the memory limit and turn this behavior off.
